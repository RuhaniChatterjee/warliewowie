    <h2>The Motivation</h2>
    <p>This project was honestly made as a fun way to spread awareness about the tribal arts of India because theyâ€™re quite underrated for their simplicity.
    <br><br>Originally it was supposed to be a project where users came and interacted with this in a physical space, but unfortunately that couldnt happen due to the current pandemic.
    <br><br>Inspired by Mr. Nitin Dhonde and Mrs Ambika, our guest faculties for Animation and New Media Studies respectively, I thought of a more modern approach to tribal art. With Warli being easiest to code, I took it as a good start to my efforts in making this project come to life</p>

    <br><h2>The Tools Used</h2>
    <p>All that was really needed to mainly set it up was the PoseNet library, used in p5js, and basic HTML/CSS code.
    <br><br>And of course, a laptop and a webcam</p>

    <br><img src="process.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;">

    <br><h2>The Process</h2>
    <p>Using the tools above I was able to code limb point to point mapping that is live tracking by :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nose</li>
        <li>Shoulders</li>
        <li>Elbows</li>
        <li>Wrists</li>
        <li>Hips</li>
        <li>Knees</li>
        <li>Ankles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And using the basic shapes used in warli (circle, triangles, lines), the whole code in essence turns you into a piece of warli yourself!</p>

    <br><h2>A small "test"</h2>
    <p>When it was decided I'm doing this as my actual design project, I got to thinking.</p>
    <strong>"What's the point of this? What's the reason I want to pursue this so badly?"</strong>
    <p>And while thinking, I sent it to my friends
        <br><br><img src="test1.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: inline-block;" height="200px">
        <img src="test2.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: inline-block;" height="200px">
        <img src="test3.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; display: inline-block;" height="200px">
    <br><br>Within minutes I was getting videos of them dancing and telling me "this is the most fun I've had in the pandemic"
    <br>Followed by "what is it?"</p> 
    <p>And for me, that settled it. Creating awareness of a popular but underrated artform in a fun way, to be used as a base project with as many uses as one can think of</p>
